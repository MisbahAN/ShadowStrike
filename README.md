# ShadowStrike

This project is a platformer game created using the Pygame library, following a tutorial series by **DaFluffyPotato** on YouTube. Pygame is a powerful Python library for creating games, offering tools to handle graphics, sounds, and inputs, making it ideal for developing 2D games.

## Learning Goals

Through this project, I learned:
- The fundamentals of game development with Pygame
- Key concepts like tile maps, physics, and collision detection
- Advanced features such as particles, animation, camera control, and AI
- How to organize a game project and create an executable version

## Project Overview

The game features:
- Tile-based levels with scrolling and parallax backgrounds
- Basic player mechanics: jumping, dashing, and attacking
- Enemies with simple AI, level transitions, and a basic level editor
- Advanced features like screen shake, particles, and animations
- Audio integration for sound effects and music
- Performance optimization for rendering tiles
- A camera system for smoother gameplay and better visuals
- A level editor for creating custom levels

## Features Implemented

1. **Game Loop**: Completed the game loop with polished mechanics and features.
2. **Audio**: Background music and sound effects for various events.
3. **Visual Effects**: Added outlines, smooth transitions, and screen shake effects.
4. **Enemies**: AI-driven enemy characters with interaction and movement.
5. **Dash & Jump-Slide**: Quick dash and smooth jump-slide mechanics.
6. **Particles**: Particle effects for actions like explosions and jumps.
7. **Level Editor**: A basic editor for customizing game levels.
8. **Animations**: Fluid animations for both player and enemy characters.
9. **Optimized Tile Rendering**: Optimized tile management for better performance.
10. **Camera System**: Enhanced camera system and sky rendering.
11. **Physics & Collisions**: Handling gravity, player mechanics, and tile-based collisions.

## How to Use This Repository

### Folder Structure:
- **data/**: Folder containing game assets such as images, sounds, etc.
- **scripts/**: Folder containing Python scripts for the game.
- **map.json**: JSON file containing map layout data.
- **game.py**: The main game file where the game runs.
- **editor.py**: Tool to edit and create custom game levels.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- Install **Pygame** using the following command:
  
  ```bash
  pip install pygame-ce

- Make sure you're in the **correct repository** (ShadowStrike) when running the game.py file.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MisbahAN/pygame-platformer.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   cd ShadowStrike

3. Run the game:

   python game.py
